### What this proof represents

This verification establishes the **genetic identity** of the tested coffee sample as _Coffea arabica_ **Pacamara**, verified through 41 SNP markers under the **World Coffee Research Low-Density Panel (WCR LDP v2024-04-12)**.

The test was performed by **Intertek Agritech (ISO 17025)** using **KASP SNP genotyping** and analyzed via **assignPOP (R 1.2.5)**.  
A **membership probability of 0.96** exceeds the TrustlessMark classification threshold (≥ 0.90), confirming a confident match.

### Interpretation

- The genetic fingerprint aligns with the _Pacamara_ reference cluster derived from samples in **El Salvador and Honduras**, used during WCR’s 2024 validation campaign.  
- This confirms **variety identity** for the sample submitted by **Flying Circus Coffee — Dallas, Texas, USA**.  
- The result supports a **“Variety Identity Verified”** claim under TrustlessMark’s *Genetic Origin* verification class.

### Notes & Limitations

- The current reference panel applies to _Coffea arabica_ only.  
- Country-level origin inference remains probabilistic and should be supplemented with supply-chain trace proofs for full geographic authentication.  
- Hybrid or Robusta detections are not covered until the Robusta dataset release (expected 2025-Q4).
